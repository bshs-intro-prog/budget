## Problem statement for the budget program:
Compare income to expenses
## Requirements for the Favorite Foods program:
1. Start with the included code sample
1. Include the following information in your file header:
    1. the program name
    1. what the program does
    1. the authors’ names
    1. the date
    1. any unresolved bugs
1. Make the following modifications to your program and then save it, rerun it, 
and debug and fix any errors you have:
    1. At the beginning of the program (before you prompt for the budget items), 
    prompt the user for a monthly income.
    1. Assign the income amount to an appropriately named variable. 
    Make sure you convert the input to floating point.
    1. Near the end of the program but before printing out the monthly expenses, 
    print out the monthly income (for example, “Your monthly income is”).
    1. At what you think is an appropriate location in the program, 
    calculate the amount of money the user has left at the end of the month 
    (after all expenses have been paid).
    1. Assign the amount left to a variable named remainder.
    1. Print out a statement to the user stating how much he or she has left 
    and reminding the user to put it into a savings account. 
1. If in testing your program you find that the user is left in debt 
(that is, the remainder is a negative number) at the end of the month, 
go back and either increase the monthly income or decrease the expenses. 
1. Add a car payment to your Budget program, Save it, 
rerun it, debug it, and fix any errors.
    1. Add a user prompt for a monthly car payment. Name the variable car_cost. 
    1. Put the monthly car cost into the statement that adds up all the monthly expenses, 
    so that your expense total includes your monthly car payment.
    1. If your expenses exceed your income, rerun your program with a 
    higher income or lower expenses.
1. Run your program, and correct any errors you find. 
1. Be sure none of the words in your print statement run together. 
1.  Capture an image of your program execution. Alt-PrintSc captures the active window.
1.  Name the image "budget.jpg" and add it to this repository.
